I needed to read in FPGA the MAC adress from the Microchip 11AA02E48T-I/TT EEPROM.
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find any VHDL nor Verilog core supporting
the UNI/O protocol used by that chip.
Below are the sources of the minimalistic controller capable of performing basic
read and write opertions in that EEPROM.
Probably it may also be used with other chips using the UNI/O protocol.

The design was based on the documentation from Microchip:
http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/devicedoc/22076d.pdf
http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/20002122D.pdf

The code is published as PUBLIC DOMAIN or Creative Commond CC0 1.0 Universal license.
You use it on your own risk, however it worked for me.
Please also make sure that your use of UNI/O protocol does not violate any patents.
