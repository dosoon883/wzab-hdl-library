The ipbus_addr_decode.vhd file is created from the addr_table file
using the script addr_dec.py, found in directory:
ipbus_2_0_v1/firmware/ipbus_core/scripts/addr_dec
after downloading the firmware sources with
$svn co http://svn.cern.ch/guest/cactus/tags/ipbus_fw/ipbus_2_0_v1

You'll also need the ipbus_addr_decode.vhd.tmpl from the same
directory, and the bitstring.py file, which you can find here:
https://code.google.com/p/python-bitstring/
or at direct link: https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/b/bitstring/bitstring-3.1.3.zip#md5=1db5d54ee269f6b54d50c3eb257eea4b
